# SSS (Special Support Section) Landing Page

## Description
This project was submitted as the requirement for passing the course [Belajar Dasar Pemrograman Web](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/123-belajar-dasar-pemrograman-web) on Dicoding. The theme was inspired by the fictional police division Special Support Section (SSS) from Trails from Zero.
